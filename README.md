# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity journey! This repository is a growing collection of daily projects, showcasing skills in penetration testing, scripting, and Linux administration. Starting with SQL injection on DVWA, I’m building practical experience to complement my Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

## Day 1: SQL Injection on DVWA
- **Objective**: Explored SQL injection vulnerabilities manually and via Python automation.
- **Tools**: Kali Linux (VM on M1/M2 Mac Mini), DVWA, Python (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`).
- **Achievements**:
  - Manually tested `id=1` and `1' OR '1'='1` in DVWA’s SQL Injection page (security level: Low).
  - Developed `day1_sql_test.py` to automate login and data retrieval.
- **Files**:
  - `day1_manual_sql_injection.png`: Manual test screenshot.
  - `day1_sql_test.py`: Python automation script.
  - `day1_python_result.png`: Script execution screenshot.
  - `day1_script_output.txt`: Script terminal output.
  - `day1_setup_commands.txt`: Key setup commands (e.g., `sudo apt install apache2 mariadb-server php8.4-fpm`).
- **Challenges**:
  - Resolved Apache/MariaDB stops, PHP-FPM setup, and GUI/X11 issues for screenshots.
  - Overcame Python package install errors with `--break-system-packages`.

## Future Plans
- Add daily projects (e.g., Day 2: CTF challenges, Day 3: Network scanning).
- Organize into folders (`day1/`, `day2/`) as I learn Git.
- Enhance scripts with advanced injections and parsing.
